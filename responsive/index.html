        <article><h1 class="adshead">Adopt, Don't Shop!</h1>
        <p> In the following article, we will explain the reasons that it is always better to adopt than to shop!</p>
        <h3>1. Strong First Reason</h3>
        <p>First, it is really important that you understand the first reason. This is one of the reasons that it is super important to adopt and to not shop. If you adopt, it is also very important to know this. </p>
        <h3>2. Another Reason</h3>
        <p>You may have thought this reason was common sense, but sometimes it is not. It's hard to think about reasons such as this one when you're making big decisions and are already stressed with big choices such as responsibilities and breeds. </p>
        <h3>3. Yet Another Good Reason</h3>
        <p>Did you know that this reason is the most unknown reason of them all? Studies show that reason 3 of this list is the one that people don't know the most, but the one that people say that they wish that they had know the most. Crazy, right? </p>
        <h3>4. Would You Look at That? Another Reason</h3>
        <p>This reason is very good to know because it reminds us of all of the other reasons, but not in a bad way, in a reaffirming way, but not in a way that allows us to have a wrap up, because that's the next reason. </p>
        <h3>5. Last Reason</h3>
        <p>Finally, you have to do this because of this reason. It is the driving point and I hope that it really makes ya think about all of the other reasons as well as this one! Thanks for reading!  </p>
