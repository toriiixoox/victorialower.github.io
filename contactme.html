                    <article id="aboutmedesc">
                        <p>I am a Junior at Bowling Green State University pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Technology. I am majoring in visual communication technology with a specialization in Interactive Media and Video. In my past, I've done work as a Social Media Manager and have created social media accounts and a website for a construction company. </p>
                        <p> This past semester, I have found my passion for coding. The entire process, from designing an efficient wireframe that accomplishes key tasks to translating that into code, excites me. Previously, I have used website builders to create websites, but the control and freedom that you get with coding your own websites is unmatched. </p>
                        <p> My other hobbies include video games, socializing with friends and family, illustration, and typography. My love for graphic design, fonts, and illustration paired with my passion for coding, and user experience and interface is why I am a great candidate for internships, co-ops, and job positions. </p>
